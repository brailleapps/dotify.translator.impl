### I want to suggest a feature.

Then you open an issue under [issues](https://github.com/brailleapps/dotify.translator.impl/issues) and follow the

### I want to contribute code. 

Before you begin if you are a new contributor it's helpful for you to visit our wiki at [wiki](https://github.com/brailleapps/wiki/wiki) there you can find extensive documentation and other helpful information that can help you make a contribution.

1. Create an issue describing the problem you're having or the feature you need. Try to be clear, concise and descriptive.
1. Unless the issue you're having is trivial, you should discuss with the team about possible solutions before you begin working on it. Discussions should be held on Github or replicated so other interested parties can contribute with their knowledge and follow progress.
1. Solve the problem. Unless there is a good reason not to, you should follow applicable guidelines and conventions, for example the [Principles](https://github.com/brailleapps/wiki/wiki/Principles).
1. Rebase your change so that it is ahead of the current master.
1. Make sure that your change works by running all applicable tests.
1. Make a PR and ask for a review.

That's it! If there are issues with your change, the team will contact you. If the current master has moved and it conflicts with your PR, you might be asked to rebase it again. You're responsible for resolving any conflicts with master until your PR has been merged.

### Code style

We are trying to keep an consistant coding convention in order to help readablility and make it easy to submit code.

More in-depth guidelines can be found at [Principles](https://github.com/brailleapps/wiki/wiki/Principles)
